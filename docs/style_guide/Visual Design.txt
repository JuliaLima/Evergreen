3. Visual Design
----------------

3.1 Color
~~~~~~~~~

A color palette summarizes all the color used across the web application. Each color was selected carefully to work harmoniously between each other. They are also gruped conceptually under the concept of hierarchical layers. There will be an order that has to be applied to the different layers in the web app. The order is defined by the less important information to the most relevant information. This hierarchical orden is adopted by the general structure, while each element in the workspace will follow the colors established in the UI Elements' guidelines.
