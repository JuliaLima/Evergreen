4. UI Elements
--------------

In a single UI design is always a wide variety of components like "Buttons, Lists, Forms, Menus, Tables, etc".

By giving them a guideline to follow, designers and developers will achieve consistency. These elements are divided in:

* Input Controls: These elements involve data input, modifications and call to action.
* Navigational Components: Elements that help the user to locate and understand the path between the different user interfaces of the application.
* Informational Components: Enable the organization and clarity of the information provided in the screens.

Users have become familiar with elements acting in a certain way, so choosing to adopt those elements when appropriate will help with task completion, efficiency, and satisfaction.

4.1 Input Controls
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

4.1.1 Buttons
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

They are a text or image that illustrate an action and invite the user to click it. There are three types of buttons:

* Primary Button: This button will be the most used. Alone or accompanied by other type of buttons.
* Accent Button: Used jointly with the primary button to create a noticeable difference between buttons, therefore, both options are important, is one or the other.
* Flat Button: This type of button is not composed by a background. It is used in structural bars  mainly.

*Specs*

[black]*Primary buttons will be:*

* Font
    - Roboto Regular.
    - Font size: 16px (1em).
    - Font color: white (#FFFFFF).
* Background
    - Rectangle with a 5px corner radius.
    - Lineal Gradient from # 0A5D8E to # 0A5582.
	- Light will be always at the top of the button.

*Button Content*

Buttons of any type can contain only text, only an icon (Bootstrap Glyphicon Halflings set) or both. They can also function as a dropdown menu trigger. Here are the possible combinations (for both, with background and flat buttons):

image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JuliaLima/OPWInternship/master/Final/UI%20Elements/Input/buttons-13.png[]

*Metrics*

Any type of buttons will have a fixed height, while the width will vary along the word or icon containing.

image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JuliaLima/OPWInternship/master/Final/UI%20Elements/Input/buttons-02.png[]

As said, text will be 16px in a center alignment. Margins around the whole text will be 1em.

image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JuliaLima/OPWInternship/master/Final/UI%20Elements/Input/buttons-03.png[]

If the button is a combination of text and an icon:

image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JuliaLima/OPWInternship/master/Final/UI%20Elements/Input/buttons-11.png[]

If the button contains only an icon:

image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JuliaLima/OPWInternship/master/Final/UI%20Elements/Input/buttons-09.png[]

If the button functions as a dropdown trigger:

*State*

Not pressed:

image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JuliaLima/OPWInternship/master/Final/UI%20Elements/Input/buttons-06.png[]

When pressing:

image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JuliaLima/OPWInternship/master/Final/UI%20Elements/Input/buttons-07.png[]

Gradient will be eliminate, so the background color will change to:

* Primary Button: #003354
* Accent Button: #0B6A93
* Flat Button:
    - On a dark color background will be white in both states.
	- On a light / white background will be dark gray in both states.

Disable:

When a button is not available it will look like:

image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JuliaLima/OPWInternship/master/Final/UI%20Elements/Input/buttons-14.png[]

This is achieved by applying opacity=0.5 to the text/icon/both in primary, accent and flat buttons. In the first two the background will retain its color as established.

4.1.2 Checkboxes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Allows the user to select one or more options from a set. Checkboxes are going to be located:

* At the right side of a word if it is the only option that the user can check

image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JuliaLima/OPWInternship/master/Final/UI%20Elements/Input/checkbox-01.png[]

* At the left side of a set of options if the user can perform a multiple selection

image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JuliaLima/OPWInternship/master/Final/UI%20Elements/Input/checkbox-02.png[]

* Alone. They will be visually separated from the text, however, they correspond to a specific option.

image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JuliaLima/OPWInternship/master/Final/UI%20Elements/Input/checkbox-05.png[]

It is going to be used the default input type="checkbox" to apply this element in a UI. Every checkbox will be located 1em from the word (left or right side) or in a center alignment.

*State*

Unchecked:

4.1.3 Expand/collapse
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When there is lack of space or there is information that can be hidden momentarily to perform other actions but should be easily accessible, this resource is used. This control is illustrated by an icon from the Bootstrap Glyphicon Halflings set:

* glyphicon-resize-full:

image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JuliaLima/OPWInternship/master/ui%20elements/expand%20collapse-01.png[]

* glyphicon-resize-small:

image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JuliaLima/OPWInternship/master/ui%20elements/expand%20collapse-02.png[]

The icon will have 1em of width. Its color will vary depending on the backgruond color: if the background color is white or a light color, use #231F20 (dark gray); if the background color is a dark color, use #FFFFFF (white).

4.1.4 Dropdown Menu
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Dropdown menu allow the user to select an item at a time and perform different activities. It is also a way to save space. There are two types:

* With icons: Used when the items involves primary actions. These actions will imply modifications on a specific element permanently or a redirection to different parts of the web site.

image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JuliaLima/OPWInternship/master/Final/UI%20Elements/Input/dropdown%20menu-01.png[]

* Without icons: To display secondary actions. Actions that can be applied in a specific element but will not modify the content on the screen.

4.1.6 Toggles
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Toggles allow the user to change between some options one by one. The arrow pointing to the left symbolizes going backwards; the arrow pointing to the right represents going forwards.
There are two different types:

* Common toggle: Illustrated by two little buttons with a left and right arrow within each background. 
* Tips toggle: Its structure, metrics and specs are the same as flat buttons, the difference is that in a normal state means it is inactive and when it is yellow means it is active. This type of toggle is applied to a specific action: tooltips in the UI. It is located in the right side of the title/action bar.

*Metrics*

Common toggles will measure:

[black]*Default:* When the text field is in its default state, it will look like:

image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JuliaLima/OPWInternship/master/Final/UI%20Elements/Input/fields-05.png[]

[black]*Filled:* Once it is completed or the option is selected (in the dropdown or toggle field types), will look like this:

image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JuliaLima/OPWInternship/master/Final/UI%20Elements/Input/fields-06.png[]

The difference is the text color: light gray (# BCBEC0) turns into dark gray (#231F20).

*Clarification:* In the multiple lines text field the text will be written always in dark gray (#231F20), this means that it doesn´t have different states.

4.1.8 Forms
^^^^^^^^^^^

This element allows a user to enter data which is sent to a server for processing. They can also be used to retrieve information from a server. Forms are composed by labels, text fields and buttons or text fields an buttons.

*Specs*

image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JuliaLima/OPWInternship/master/Final/UI%20Elements/Input/form-02.png[]

image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JuliaLima/OPWInternship/master/Final/UI%20Elements/Input/form-01.png[]

[black]*With Label:* A label is going to be next to each text field when the form requires three fields. That label will be the indication of the information to enter in the text field; it is left aligned because this makes easier some specific needs like scanning for a particular field. Help text inside the text field can work as an example of what to introduce or that the field is required or optional; it is not neccessary to use it in every case, just when needed.

From three field will be located below each other. Buttons are located in the bottom of the fields in a right alignment.

image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JuliaLima/OPWInternship/master/Final/UI%20Elements/Input/form-03.png[]

[black]*Large forms:* Forms that are divided into more than one related sections are called large forms. They are composed by subheaders, lables, text fiels and, sometimes, by buttons (remember: if large UI elements occupy the whole screen, actions that are applied to the entire page should be located in the title/action bar).

image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JuliaLima/OPWInternship/master/Final/UI%20Elements/Input/form-04.png[]

Large forms need space, so they are located in the workspace and are not accompanied by any other element due to the large number of elements involved in the page. They are presented in a single column. Metrics of fields, subheaders and labels are:

image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JuliaLima/OPWInternship/master/Final/UI%20Elements/Input/form-05.png[]

There are a table of content, a search field and some filters in the right top of the large form. Those elements help users find specific fields or  manage the visualization of needed fields. Is very usefull when forms are too large and exceed the height of the screen. By clicking each item in the table of contents, users can get to that specific portion of the form.

^^^^^^^^^^^^

This UI element is one of the most used by the Evergreen web staff client. It is used to retrieve the required information and show all the results of a search orderly. Tables are resizable, they adapt to the whole screen width or to the remaining space in the workspace. They can also resize it columns default width.

*Structure*

Tables are composed by three main areas:

image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JuliaLima/OPWInternship/master/Final/UI%20Elements/Informational/tables-01.png[]

* [black]*Table Bar:* A bar that gives the possibility of adapting the manner in which the information is displayed according to the user's need (cog icon). It will show a title, to locate the user; an Action disabled set, which applies only to the results; a Page navigator, to give freedom to visualize the information; and a Table configuration icon, to change the default table view according to the user wishes and some other options that can be made on or from the table.

image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JuliaLima/OPWInternship/master/Final/UI%20Elements/Informational/tables-02.png[]

Something important to highlight is the action set. It is composed of three buttons, the first ones will be the two most common actions, the third is a trigger button to open more actions (show as a dropdown menu).

* [black]*Columns Bar:* This section will display the a "Check all results" checkbox to implement a specific action - or set of actions- on all the results retrieved; a "Number of result" column to facilitate the observation of information and the different parts in which the result is going to be separate in.

image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JuliaLima/OPWInternship/master/Final/UI%20Elements/Informational/tables-03.png[]

* [black]*Table Results:* Where all the results retrieved are exposed. The information will be presented according to the default or options selected by the user.

*Metrics*

Table bar: Height of 2,25em. #-2 Green background color. Each icon used in this bar will have width=1em.

image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JuliaLima/OPWInternship/master/Final/UI%20Elements/Informational/tables-04.png[]

Columns Bar: Height of 2,25em.

image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JuliaLima/OPWInternship/master/Final/UI%20Elements/Informational/tables-05.png[]

Table Results: Each row will have 2,25em of height. As a visual detail a row of through should have a #-2 Green background color with opacity=0.2 to help the visualization of the information starting from the first row and so on. The amount of columns will be always 8 (without the number of column and the checkbox columns) as a default.

image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JuliaLima/OPWInternship/master/Final/UI%20Elements/Informational/tables-06.png[]

*Results States*

Table results have two posible states.

Default: Checkboxes are unchecked and actions set is disable.

image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JuliaLima/OPWInternship/master/Final/UI%20Elements/Informational/tables-07.png[]

Selected: One, more or all the checkboxes will be checked and the actions set will be enable.

4.4 Combination and Grouping
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

UI elements can be combined and grouped. This means that is posible that a single element can not work alone. Almost all combinations are possible while the grouping is given only in the tables.

4.4.1 Combinations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

4.4.2 Grouping
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
