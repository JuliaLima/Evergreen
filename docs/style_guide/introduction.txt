Evergreen UI Style Guide
------------------------
Products are made to be used. There is no reason to add effort to develop, test and document a product that won't be as much used as expected. In software products the user experience is provided mainly through the user interface, and how a user interface is developed is guided by a UI style guide.

* The purpose of this UI Style guide is to create a basis to have a consistent look and feel of the complete EvergreenÂ´s web staff client.
* Think always according to user-center design.
* It will be mainly used by developers without limiting anyone who needs to consult it.
